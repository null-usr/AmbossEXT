# AMBOSS Unit Estimator

A simple plugin for estimating SI Units from Reference Units on the AMBOSS platform.<br>
Solely an estimator because it uses the provided lab table to estimate a conversion ratio between SI and RU values instead of calculating the value itself.

This isn't meant to replace any memorization or learning that needs to be done, just give an estimate for the values that can be more easily investigated later on.
